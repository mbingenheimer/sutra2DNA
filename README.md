This is the code we distribute as part of the sutra2DNA project at Temple University.

website: Contains the Flask code for a website exemplifying three different ways of encoding unicode text in DNA. It illustrates two different types of erasure and error-correcting codes, and compares these with a simple transform without error correction.

This project is supported by a Temple Presidential Humanities and Arts Grant.
